#Introduction
Knowing how to communicate effectively to your team member as well as to your supervisor(s) is really important. For developers, 
this communication skill set may be as important as your coding skills.

A bad coder with poor communication skills leads to getting fired.
A bad coder with great communication skills leads to a mediocre employee.
A great coder with poor communication skills leads to a mediocre employee.
A great coder with great communication skills leads to a great employee.
Here in this course, I will outline some of the key principles that I think are important. These skills apply to all roles and not just to developers. 
  These observations come from self-reflection and also from managing various employees, contractors, and executives. 
  I will also invite other folks to share their experience and share tips.

Disclaimer
1. Depending on the company you work for, the core values that are important for them may be different than the core values that I am presenting in this course. 
You can still be flexible and adjust based on your circumstance.
2. There is no ONE right answer. There are many right answers. Find an approach that you're comfortable with and do not be afraid of making mistakes and looking stupid/foolish. 
Everyone learns by making mistakes and you'll make mistakes too but people are generally kind and will forgive your mistakes if you're honest and you're making efforts to improve.
3. I am not a master in communications. If this is your first time learning topics related to communications, you can use this course as one of your first stepping stones 
to improve your communication skills. Then continue learning how to communicate more effectively as a team member, supervisor, etc. Learning how to communicate effectively 
is a lifetime pursuit.

Being vs Portraying

  
Core Value: Be Proactive
a. Don't wait to be told what to do. Proactively seek how you can add more value.
b. Proactively think about what the next move for your supervisor would be, and proactively find ways to save time for the supervisor.
This will grant you a lot more freedom to work the way you want.
c. If you were asked for an update, you're already late. Be proactive and provide updates BEFORE your supervisor/client asks for one.
d. Proactively focus on results and not just on tasks.
e. When providing an update, make sure you've met all the instructions from your supervisor. Do NOT cause your supervisor to repeat instructions AFTER you've already provided an update, 
saying your update was incomplete. Supervisors hate this, especially if they are already super busy.

Scenario 1: A New Task
Your supervisor has given you a new task over email. Should you email back? Or is it okay to not respond back as some of the instructions 
for the task were already discussed with you in the prior hand? How quickly would you respond?
My Answer: Yes, I should email back within minutes during workdays and within hours during weekend, the email may contain information
saying that you got the email.
Correct answer: You should always email back ... maybe you don't need to reply all ... but you need let the supervisor know that you got 
the new task and understood the instruction

Scenario 2: Clumsy Update
The supervisor has asked you to provide an update on your work by the end of the day. The end of the day has come but the supervisor has 
not gotten any update from you. The next morning, the update comes back with an apology that it's late. To make the matter worse, 
the supervisor was expecting you to email a few other people but the email seemed to indicate it was only sent to you... 
The supervisor also asked for an update on X, Y, and Z, but you have only provided an update on Y and Z... 
The supervisor has to email you back where they have to write back to you asking for additional things... 
Every keystroke the supervisor makes, the supervisor is wondering why their time is being wasted having to repeat instructions over again...

My answer: It's absolutely horrible to not give any updates after the supervisor asked me to provide an update by the end of the day.
I will take my initiative and send the email to few other people. Whether the X is not yet done, I must provide an update about X with Y 
and Z.
Correct Answer: Do not ever make mistake, re-read any communication with your supervisor to understand the instruction

Scenario 3: Family Emergency
You have a family emergency. Something happened and you needed to leave work immediately to take care of one of your family members. 
You notified your HR by a text message saying how you have to take the whole day off. The HR responded back saying they hope everything 
works out. Once the family situation was resolved, it is already very late around 11 PM your time. It's also weekend the next day and you 
don't want to interrupt your supervisor or the HR folks, especially as you know they are busy people and you don't want to distract them. 
You instead decide to come back to work on Monday and on Monday morning, you decide to then let your supervisor and HR folks know. 
What could have gone better in this situation?

My answer:

Scenario 4: Busy Supervisor
Your supervisor is extremely busy but you are not that satisfied with work. In fact, you're not even sure if you really belong to this 
company and the team as the supervisor doesn't seem to really appreciate what you've done. You're putting in the hours and doing all the 
things that the supervisor has asked you to do, although inside, you know you can do more. However, you are hesitant to do more, as you 
have other tasks at home and you're afraid that if you put in a lot more hours at work, your quality of life may go down (as you will be 
too busy with work). Plus, you're not getting paid enough already. Maybe, if you get the promotion, you will then start working more 
hours and do more responsibilities?
