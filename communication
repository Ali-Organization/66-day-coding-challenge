#Introduction
Knowing how to communicate effectively to your team member as well as to your supervisor(s) is really important. For developers, 
this communication skill set may be as important as your coding skills.

A bad coder with poor communication skills leads to getting fired.
A bad coder with great communication skills leads to a mediocre employee.
A great coder with poor communication skills leads to a mediocre employee.
A great coder with great communication skills leads to a great employee.
Here in this course, I will outline some of the key principles that I think are important. These skills apply to all roles and not just to developers. 
  These observations come from self-reflection and also from managing various employees, contractors, and executives. 
  I will also invite other folks to share their experience and share tips.

Disclaimer
1. Depending on the company you work for, the core values that are important for them may be different than the core values that I am presenting in this course. 
You can still be flexible and adjust based on your circumstance.
2. There is no ONE right answer. There are many right answers. Find an approach that you're comfortable with and do not be afraid of making mistakes and looking stupid/foolish. 
Everyone learns by making mistakes and you'll make mistakes too but people are generally kind and will forgive your mistakes if you're honest and you're making efforts to improve.
3. I am not a master in communications. If this is your first time learning topics related to communications, you can use this course as one of your first stepping stones 
to improve your communication skills. Then continue learning how to communicate more effectively as a team member, supervisor, etc. Learning how to communicate effectively 
is a lifetime pursuit.

Being vs Portraying

  
Core Value: Be Proactive
a. Don't wait to be told what to do. Proactively seek how you can add more value.
b. Proactively think about what the next move for your supervisor would be, and proactively find ways to save time for the supervisor.
This will grant you a lot more freedom to work the way you want.
c. If you were asked for an update, you're already late. Be proactive and provide updates BEFORE your supervisor/client asks for one.
d. Proactively focus on results and not just on tasks.
e. When providing an update, make sure you've met all the instructions from your supervisor. Do NOT cause your supervisor to repeat instructions AFTER you've already provided an update, 
saying your update was incomplete. Supervisors hate this, especially if they are already super busy.
