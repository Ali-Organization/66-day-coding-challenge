What is MIDDLEWARE function?
A middleware function is typically a function that takes three parameters: req (request), res (response), and next. 
The next parameter is a function that, when called, passes control to the next middleware function or route handler in the stack.

What is ROOT-LEVEL REQUEST LOGGER MIDDLEWARE?
A "root-level request logger middleware" acts like a checkpoint at the entrance of a road. When a car (request) enters, 
this special checkpoint, known as a "logger," takes note of important information about the car. 
It records details such as the type of car (GET, POST, etc.), the road it's taking (route), and the license plate of the driver 
(IP address). Just like a security log keeps track of who's coming in and out, a logger helps developers monitor and understand the 
flow of activity in their web application by creating a record of each request.
