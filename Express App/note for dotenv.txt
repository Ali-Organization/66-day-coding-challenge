1. Install 'dotenv' using npm:
- To install the 'dotenv' package using npm, you run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
npm install dotenv
```
- This command downloads and installs the 'dotenv' package from the npm registry.

2. Without 'dotenv', the .env file cannot be read:
- The 'dotenv' package provides functionality to read and load environment variables from a '.env' file into the process.env object in your Node.js application.
- Without 'dotenv', you would need to manually read the contents of the '.env' file and set the environment variables, which can be more cumbersome.

3. When 'dotenv' is installed, the 'node_modules' folder is imported or created:
- After running npm install dotenv, npm downloads the 'dotenv' package and adds it to your project's 'node_modules' folder.
- The 'node_modules' folder is a standard location where npm installs project-specific dependencies.
- The 'dotenv' package, along with its code and dependencies, is stored within this 'node_modules' folder.


#Before running the npm install dotenv command, you should make sure that your terminal or command prompt is currently in the directory (folder) where your Node.js project is located. To navigate to the correct directory, you can use the cd command (change directory). Here's an example:
```
cd path/to/your/project
```
Replace path/to/your/project with the actual path to your Node.js project. Once you are in the correct directory, 
you can then run the ```npm install dotenv``` command to install the dotenv package for that specific project.

#After installing, you can require and configure dotenv in your Node.js script as mentioned earlier:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
```
This ensures that dotenv looks for the .env file in the root of your project directory.
